# Welcome to the Therapy Bot 3000&trade;

The Therapy Bot 3000&trade; meets all your mental health needs. No need to go to bad therapists when you've got the Therapy Bot 3000&trade;

## Therapy Bot 3000&trade; responds to patient input in a number of different ways:
* If a post contains the word "sad", Therapy Bot 3000&trade; responds with a gif of Billy Crystal offering a box of tissues.
* If a post contains the word "angry", Therapy Bot 3000&trade; responds with "So like...?" and a gif of Grumpy Cat blowing up a mansion.
* If a post is in all caps, Therapy Bot 3000&trade; randomly selects a text response from an array of responses to patient yelling.
* If a post meets none of those conditions, Therapy Bot 3000&trade; randomly selects a response from a different array. One of these responses is a function that posts "..."" once every second, then says "interesting".
* If the patient has made more than seven posts, the Therapy Bot 3000&trade; listens for keyup events, and after the tenth keyup, Therapy Bot 3000&trade; disables the form inputs and clears the chat container of everything but a box that says "I'm afraid that's all the time we have today."

## Goals in building Therapy Bot 3000&trade;:
* Fulfill a longstanding creative vision.
* Work with objects, avoid large/unwieldy if-else statements, use regular expressions, ternaries 4ever, use different means of searching strings for substrings.
